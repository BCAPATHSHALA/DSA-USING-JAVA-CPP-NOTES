1. What is the best time complexity of bubble sort?

Ans: O(n) when the array is already sorted.

2. Assume that we use Bubble Sort to sort n distinct elements in ascending order. When does the best case of Bubble Sort occur?

Ans: When elements are sorted in ascending order
like: 4,5,7,8,9,10

3. The number of swappings needed to sort the numbers 8, 22, 7, 9, 31, 5, 13 in ascending order, using bubble sort is

Ans: round 01: 4
     round 02: 3
     round 03: 1
     round 04: 1
     round 05: 1
     Total Swapped: 10

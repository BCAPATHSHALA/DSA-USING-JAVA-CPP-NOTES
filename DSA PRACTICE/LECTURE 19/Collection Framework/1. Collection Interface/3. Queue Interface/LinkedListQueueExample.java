/* Class 1: LinkedList 

LinkedList is a class which is implemented in the collection framework which inherently implements the linked list data structure. It is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node. Due to the dynamicity and ease of insertions and deletions, they are preferred over the arrays or queues. Letâ€™s see how to create a queue object using this class.

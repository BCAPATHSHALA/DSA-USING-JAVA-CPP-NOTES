Set Interface: 
_______________

A set is an unordered collection of objects in which duplicate values cannot be stored. 
This set interface is implemented by various classes like HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet, etc. For example, 

📝Syntax: This type of safelist can be defined as:
__________________________________________________

Set<T> set = new HashSet<> (); 
Set<T> set = new LinkedHashSet<> (); 
Set<T> set = new TreeSet<> (); 

🤢Note: Where T is the type of the object to be stored in List 

Operations on the Set Interface: (UNSORTED SET)
_______________________________________________

set1 = [1, 3, 2, 4, 8, 9, 0]
set2 = [1, 3, 7, 5, 4, 0, 7, 5]
Then the possible operations on the sets are:

1. Intersection: retainAll()
Intersection = [0, 1, 3, 4] 

2. Union: addAll()
Union = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9] 

3. Difference: removeAll()
Difference = [2, 8, 9]

Operations on the Set Interface: (SORTED SET)
_______________________________________________

Operations 1: Adding Elements -> add()
Operations 2: Accessing elements -> contains()
Operations 3: Removing elements -> remove()
Operations 4: Iterating elements -> for each loop
Operations 5: Iterating through Set -> Iterator intarface

Map Interface: 
_______________

A map is a data structure that supports the key-value pair mapping for the data. This interface doesn’t support duplicate keys because the same key cannot have multiple mappings.

This map interface is implemented by various classes like HashMap, TreeMap, etc. Since all the subclasses implement the map, we can instantiate a map object with any of these classes. For example,

📝Syntax: This type of safelist can be defined as:
__________________________________________________

Map<T> map = new HashMap<> (); 
Map<T> map = new TreeMap<> ();
Map<T> map = new LinkedHashMap<> (); 
 

🤢Note: Where T is the type of the object to be stored in List 

Operations on the Set Interface: (UNSORTED SET)
_______________________________________________

Operations 1: Adding Elements -> put()
Operation 2: Changing Element -> put()
Operations 3: Removing elements -> remove()
Operations 4: Iterating elements -> through map

Collections in Java:
____________________

Any group of individual objects which are represented as a single unit is known as the collection of the objects.

The Collection interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface (java.util.Map) are the two main ‚Äúroot‚Äù interfaces of Java collection classes.

What is a Framework?
____________________

A framework is a set of classes and interfaces which provide a ready-made architecture. In order to implement a new feature or a class, there is no need to define a framework.


Advantages of the Collection Framework: 
_______________________________________

1)Consistent API: 
The API has a basic set of interfaces like Collection, Set, List, or Map, all the classes (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, etc) that implement these interfaces have some common set of methods.
 
2)Reduces programming effort: 
A programmer doesn‚Äôt have to worry about the design of the Collection but rather he can focus on its best use in his program. Therefore, the basic concept of Object-oriented programming (i.e.) abstraction has been successfully implemented.
 
3)Increases program speed and quality: 
Increases performance by providing high-performance implementations of useful data structures and algorithms because in this case, the programmer need not think of the best implementation of a specific data structure. He can simply use the best implementation to drastically boost the performance of his algorithm/program.
